Wow! It's a gret honor to be here tonight. I wasn't expenting this.
I would like to thank:

* Jose for suggestin:
    - User manual (more or less done).
    - Support direct sharing (thinking about it).
* Noe for suggesting:
    - Use cases for testing (I'm on it).
* Charlie for suggesting:
    - Font change. On my defense I have to say he tested it before I added the stylesheet. I was
	going to do it. I swear!
    - Filtering (testing).
* Dani for testing the thing
* Gara for translation suggestions

And last but not least I would like to thank all the testers I've spammed. I won't name you all
because you are too many.
