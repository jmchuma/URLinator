URLinator
===============================

Many times I've wanted to copy the URLs from the pages I had opened to a text
file, and I've always found my self doing it one by one. This may not be a big
issue if there are only a few open tabs, but when you have many it become
tiresome. For this reason (and because I wanted to try chrome.** API too) I
decided to create this extension. The goal is to allow users to:

* Copy all URLs from the current window to a text area or to the clipboard.
* Copy all URLs from all windows to a text area or to the clipboard.
* Get URLs from the text area (or from the clipboard) and open them in
new tabs in the current window.
    + URLs must be separated in different lines.
    + URLs without an scheme (the _whatever://_ at the beginning) are treated as
	  search terms and sent to Google search engine.

Installation
------------

For the time being the extension is not available on Chrome Web Store (and I
don't know if it will ever be) so go to the [download page](URLinator/downloads "Download page")
and grab the latest version.

How to do stuff with the thing.

### Controls

Clicking the extension button pops up something like this:

![Popup controls](URLinator/raw/master/img/popup.png "Popup controls")

This is how it works:

* **First checkbox:**
    - Checked: get URLs from tabs in all windows.
    - Unchecked: get URLs from tabs in the current window.
* **Second checkbox:** allows interaction with the clipboard.
    - Checked: get and put content directly to the clipboard.
    - Unchecked: get and put content in the text area.
* **Filter box:** allows to use words as filters when retrieving or opening URLs. **Not ready yet.**
* **Textarea:** works as input and output (if the second checkbox is not selected).
* **Open button:** opens new tabs with the URLs and search terms.
* **Copy button:** grabs the URLs from the tabs.
